These rules help keep the UI consistent across multiple independent products.

## Components

### ✅ Do

- Use Aura components for common controls (buttons/inputs/selects) to keep UX consistent.
- Prefer props/slots over custom CSS for variations.
- Keep component API **stable** (rename/remove in MAJOR releases only).

### ❌ Don't

- Copy components into products “just to tweak one thing”. Add a prop/variant instead.
- Add product-specific business logic into the UI-kit.
- Hardcode text strings inside components that should be localized at the app level.

## Tokens

### ✅ Do

- Add new tokens before introducing new visual patterns.
- Keep tokens semantic (`--text`, `--panel`) and stable.

### ❌ Don't

- Rename/remove tokens casually.
- Introduce implementation-driven tokens (`--blue-500`) as the primary API.

## Accessibility basics

- Maintain text/background contrast.
- Ensure focus states are visible (`--ring`, `--field-border-focus`).
- Provide disabled and loading states.
